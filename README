A crate which demonstrates using mioco to concurrently read and write to an OpenSSL TLS stream.

I wanted an example like this, but couldn't find it, so I figured I would strip down the application I came up with and publish an understandable example.

Using mio+OpenSSL without mioco would look roughly similar, though the code would be organized differently.

Released under the WTFPL.
